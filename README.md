### Description of the diary

Teddy came up to me (American)</br>
The story is this:

He worked for an Indian e-currency exchange company.

He attached links to the site of an Indian crypto exchange company and others.

They had a miner client, he often cashed btc through them.</br>
Once he turned to them with a request to restore the key in a burnt diary.

At that time it was 2017-2018. The btc rate was low, the search for the key was unprofitable.</br>
There were no programs for recovering a key on a GPU yet.</br>
The GPU cards were weaker than the GTX 1080.</br>
Perhaps there was a program on the processor, but it would take millions of years to find the key on it.

The photo in the diary changed hands and came to me in the spring of 2022 from Taddi.</br> 
For this task, the WifSolverCuda program was made. A [challenge](https://github.com/jonlloner/wif500) was made on its modification.

About the [challenge](https://github.com/jonlloner/wif500):</br>
The large range has been split into 3364 ranges (58*58)</br>
The challenge began, the passage of the ranges was recorded by screenshots and [recorded in the table manually](https://github.com/jonlloner/wif500/blob/main/x64/Release/table.md).</br> 
Since % of the pool was relied on for participation. Hunters began to fake screenshots of the passage.</br>
They were hoping someone else would find it and they would get a big % of the pool.</br>
I protected the fake with a hex id. It didn't work, because with the big hash step they faked the walkthrough again.</br>
As a result, some hunters spent their money, others forged. As a result, 2000 ranges passed, of which half are fake.</br> 
Several people confessed to falsifying the results. The challenge has been stopped.</br>

Now the search happens in the pool, which has many advantages:</br>
The search speed is several times higher.</br>
There is support for multigpu.</br>
Accurate statistics</br>
There are no fakes, how much passed, so much is your% of the pool.

If there is a key, we will find it!</br>
Don't wait, search now</br>

Addition:
One of the hunters contacted the owner of the diary to find out more. information from the owner. The owner is from India.</br>
According to him, the diary is real. As evidence, he made inscriptions on the inside of the diary and a new photograph of the key.</br>
See photos [**here**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125174641/218313586-287f080e-9bc8-4f06-8b7d-0a2fbceb8743.jpg) and [**here**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125174641/218313489-b1d8ab4e-8d3a-4d6a-b584-d15fcdf7127e.jpg)</br>
The hunter wanted to clarify the symbols of the key and got a better picture of the desired part:</br>
